# Hi :wave: intrigued Human!

This is my Docker Playground.

- Docker is a very interesting technology and I love the complexity handling it. It really makes all my broad knowledge come together.
- My projects on here, so far, are simple Docker-Compose configurations with clusters running different tech stacks.

## Projects:

### [WordPress with Reverse Proxy](./wprp/)
- This cluster launches a WordPress instance with a nginx reverse proxy in front of it.

### [Redis 2.0](./redis/)
- Stack built on:
    - MongoDB
    - PostgreSQL
    - Redis
    - Express

### [MERRN](./redis-mongo/)
- Stack built on:
    - MongoDB
    - Redis
    - Express

### [LAMP](./lamp/)
- a classic LAMP stack with phpMyAdmin
